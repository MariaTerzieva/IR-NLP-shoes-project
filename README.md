README

This is my project for the Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing courses at FMI. The documentation of the project in Bulgarian can be found in the PDF files. Scrapy is used for scraping information from three websites selling shoes. Data is stored in MongoDB. You need to scrape the data before running the application. It is possible that you run into problems because the structure of the websites may have changed since I wrote the code. You need to have elasticsearch-2.2.0 installed to run the project. First run the elasticsearch server and then the rails server from within the calceus directory with `rails s`. Make sure to run `bundle install` before that (again from within the calceus directory). The search functionality is available at http://localhost:3000/search.
