README
======

This is my project for the Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing courses at FMI. The documentation of the project in Bulgarian can be found in the PDF files. You need to have elasticsearch-2.2.0 installed to run the project. First run the elasticsearch server and then the rails server from within the calceus directory with `rails s`. Make sure to run `bundle install` and `rake db:migrate` before that (again from within the calceus directory). The search functionality is available at http://localhost:3000/search.
